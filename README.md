# World_Weather_Analysis

This analysis considers mininmum and maximum temperatures entered by the user to identify potential vacation destinations.  After the temperature requirements are entered, the code will retrieve the latitude and longitude for the cities that meet the criteria and plot them on a map.  The code will then build a driving map between four cities manually selected during the coding process (i.e. not selected by the user).
